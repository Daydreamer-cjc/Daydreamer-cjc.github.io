Hello World! I am Jiancong Chen, a first-year Ph.D. student at the Lyles School of Civil and Construction Engineering, Purdue University. My research interests focus on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the domain of autonomous driving, with particular emphasis on reinforcement learning (RL), human-in-the-loop (HITL), and the utilization of large language models (LLMs).

I hail from Guangdong, Chinaâ€”a region celebrated as the "City of Gastronomy". In addition to my academic pursuits, I am an avid enthusiast of rock music and badminton.

Hope you can enjoy everything here. May the force be with you.
